# Sailors Playground

Sailors Playground is a personal project aimed to explore and play with technologies such as Gulp, Sass, Pure CSS + Bootstrap, EJS Templates, and others. It consists of a static web page with some additional modals. The graphic design of this web page has been provided by third parties and is not part of my work.

[Live demo here](http://sailors-playground.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com), hosted on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/es/s3).

### Features

- Build using Gulp.
- Web page 100% responsive (tested in Chrome).
- Click on the items in the main menu or in the corresponding "buttons" (just above the "article" section) to open the modals (dates and news).

## Setup

Run `npm install`.

## Build

Run `gulp build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
